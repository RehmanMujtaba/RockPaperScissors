# Python Learning

Some old Python code I wrote in highschool

## RockPaperScissors
2 versions of rock paper scissors, one from highschool, one now
This is a simple rock paper scissors program I had made back when I first learned python in highschool

UPDATE:
Added a redone version that is far more reflective of how I code now
